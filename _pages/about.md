My name is Andrei and I'm currently working as a Junior Data Scientist at [Featurespace][fs_link], 
where I use machine learning to fight financial fraud.
  
I was born and raised in Romania.
After high-school, I went abroad to study Mathematics at the University of Cambridge - in 
my final year, I mainly took courses in the fields of Analysis, Statistics and Probability.

During the summer of 2019, I worked on a summer research project under the supervision of [Sam Power][sam_power_link].
